# garage_door
A garage door opener for Raspberry Pi, specific to my setup

This was built to interface with Homebridge, for iOS devices to access

## Parts List
- Raspberry Pi (I have the 3b)
- 2 relay module
- Jumper Cables
- Garage door opener
- Reed Switch
- Magnet

## Usage
You will have to modify the IP addresses and pins if you want to use this yourself.
This was not designed for multiple usecases, and will have to be modified.
I installed my magnet on the belt of the garage door, and the hardware sits on top of the motor.

## Disclaimer
Use at your own risk, this is my first attempt at something like this and so 
this may be a fire waiting to happen.

I am not responsible if your Rasbperry Pi turns into a Transformer, blows a hole in your driveway
and takes off with your Xbox.
